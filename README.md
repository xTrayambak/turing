# Turing, a lightweight CAPTCHA-like library to detect whether your users are humans or not!
Because, you can never be too sure!
___________
# Usage
This is a basic way of generating a CAPTCHA.
```python3
from nobot.core import Test

my_captcha = Test(case_sensitive = False, strictness = 2)

captcha_img = my_captcha.generate_img()
captcha_audio = my_captcha.generate_audio()

captcha_img.save('mycaptchaimg', format = 'png')
captcha_img_bytes = captcha_img.to_bytes()
```
___________
# Where's the random word dictionary?
You can add your own dictionary set of random words using `turing.core.Test.add_dictionary()`,
if you want to use an online API for this, then you can use `turing.core.Test.add_dictionary_from_api(url = 'myurl.xyz', pages = ['/generate_random_words'], params = {'api_key': 'TEST123'})`

___________
# How do I raise the difficulty?
Raising the `strictness` attribute (which is an int) will add random lines between the text, and the line count will increase with the level of strictness. Audio will also be distorted accordingly, with level 0 having no distortion in either audio and image and level 10 will be near impossible to clear, even for a robot.

You are welcome to contribute, but improvements to features, bug fixes are accepted rather than new features. For them, you can simply open a new Issue and if I cannot implement the feature (which is not likely), then you can feel free to implement the feature yourself.
